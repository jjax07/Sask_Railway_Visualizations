# UI Bugs to Fix

## Settlement Explorer Search Bug

**Issue:** Typing a settlement name in the search box and pressing Enter does not select the settlement. Users must click on the autocomplete suggestion from the dropdown.

**Expected behavior:** Pressing Enter after typing a valid settlement name should select that settlement and update the map.

**Current behavior:** Enter key does nothing; only clicking the dropdown suggestion works.

**File:** `settlement_explorer.html`

**Priority:** Low (cosmetic/UX issue)

**Status:** Documented - to be fixed after railway route visualization work is complete
